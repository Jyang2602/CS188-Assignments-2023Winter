The MiniPlaces dataset is a subset of the [Places2 dataset](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/) and contains 100,000 images for training, 10,000 images for validation, and 10,000 images for testing, each of which has been annotated with one of 100 different scene categories. These images are divided into three folders: train, val, and test. \n","\n","The MiniPlaces dataset is a useful resource for developing and testing image classification models, particularly those that are designed to recognize different types of environments and scenes.\n","\n","Your task for this assignment is to create two new datasets called *TinyPlaces-Binary* and *TinyPlaces-Multiclass* from the MiniPlaces dataset. Both datasets should be much smaller in size than the original MiniPlaces dataset (more details later).\n","\n","In addition to creating the TinyPlaces datasets, you will also need to implement and evaluate the performance of the following classifiers on both datasets:\n","* k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Classifier\n","* Linear/logistic/sofrmax Regression Classifier\n","\n","---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5SIGjL2GBmOw"},"source":["##Q0: Understanding the storage of colab (0 pts)\n","\n","Colab is a cloud-based service that allows users to write and run code in a Jupyter notebook-style enviroment. Colab provides users with temporary virtual machines to run their code on. \n","\n","For file storage, Colab provides users with access to a variety of storage options, including temporary storage space and Google Drive storage.\n","\n","1. Temporary storage space, also known as \"local runtime storage,\" is a space on the virtual machine (VM) that is allocated to you when you open a Colab notebook. This space is temporary in the sense that it is wiped clean whenever you close the notebook or disconnect from the VM. However, it is much faster than Google Drive storage, since it is located on the same machine as the VM. This makes it ideal for storing and accessing large datasets or intermediate data that is being used frequently in your notebook.\n","\n","2. Google Drive storage is a more permanent storage option that is accessed through your Google account. It is ***much much*** slower than temporary storage space, since it requires data to be transferred over the internet to and from the VM. However, it is useful for storing and sharing notebooks and data that you want to keep long-term, or for collaborating with other users.\n","\n","As we are going to be working with a lot of images, and to make things run smoothly, we will be using Colab's temporary storage space to store our data. This means that every time you open up this notebook, we will need to re-download and process the dataset. Don't worry though - this shouldn't take long, usually just a minute or less.

Use the file `categories_tinyplaces.txt` to select images from the target subcategories in the MiniPlaces dataset.\n","  1. Load the target subcategories and their associated class IDs from the file `categories_tinyplaces.txt`. This file contains a list of subcategory names, in the format of directory paths, and class IDs, with one pair per line. For example, a line of `/b/bathroom 16` indicates a subcategory name \"bathroom\" with a class ID of \"16\". The directory of \"bathroom\" images is located at \"root/data/images/SPLIT/b/bathroom\", where \"SPLIT\" is either train, val, or test, and 'root' is specified as `/content/MyDrive/2023-CS188/Assignment1`. There are a total of 20 subcategories in this file. The first 10 subcategories are indoor scenes, and the last 10 are outdoor scenes.\n","  2. Iterate through the images in the train and val folders and select only those that belong to one of the target subcategories in `categories_tinyplaces.txt`. For training data, take the **first** 500 images (`00000001.jpg` to `00000500.jpg`) of each subcategory in the root/data/images/train folder (500x20=10k images in total).
